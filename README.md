Hi There,

A Microcontroller is kinda Whole Computer Itself, For some reasons we wants only selected portion of whole IC(Microcontroller) like its SDRam or eeprom or its CPU. As per the eeproms are really expensive like [500-700 Rs /-] and most of times available(Specially in India). 
As an Microcontrollor is even cheaper then a EEprom and The Microcontroller also Contains Some EEProm whics is enough for some basic projects. I am going to demonstrate you how to convert the Microcontroller into an EEPROM.
