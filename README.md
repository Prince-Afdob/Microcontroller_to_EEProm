# Microcontroller to EEProm

 Convert ATmega 32A [ÂµC] to EEProm
Hi There,
I am Prince Kumar,

So I am getting to the point:-
I am Using ATmega 32A Microcontroller and Convert it into an EEProm, You can use that EEProm anywhere its whole Design is very same to some most popular, handsome and good looking ICs EEProms like:- ATmega, SST, WesternCenter etc. Microcontroller is Programmed according to the Working of an real EEProm same as AT28c256 but its has a 16-bit(1-word) Address Bus Line  and 8-bit Data Bus , with a 4-bit Control Bus.
